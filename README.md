<h4> After that should get response message in the console where are our "Server is successfully running..", something like: </h4>

## Overview
```js
A solid REST API is the foundation of virtually every modern web app, service and data-driven company/startup. 
From large multi-national corporation to small startup, the core tenets of a well-designed REST API are the same 
and can be learned in relatively short period of time. In this case, I construct a simple REST API 
using Node/Express, MongoDB. Along the way, we explore the key principles behind REST API design as well as common 
mistakes and scenarios that developers often struggle with.
